# 🚖 Uber Trip Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Uber generates millions of trip records daily, and analyzing this data helps improve **driver allocation, surge pricing, demand forecasting, and customer satisfaction**.  

This project provides an **end-to-end analysis** of Uber trips using:  
- **Power BI** → Dashboards for visualization  
- **Python** → Data Cleaning, EDA, and Interactive Charts  
- **SQL / SSMS** → Backend data analysis & queries  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Uber needs insights into:  
- **Most frequent pickup & drop-off points**  
- **Peak hours & weekdays for demand**  
- **Farthest trips and high-value rides**  
- **Revenue trends over time**  
- **Origin–Destination patterns (OD matrix)**  

Without these insights, it is difficult to optimize driver allocation, pricing, and overall operations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Power BI** (Dashboards: Location, Time, Details)  
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)  
- **SQL / SSMS** (Data queries & backend analysis)
